## Format:
Implement each network as a Python class with appropriate parameters as inputs. Use the \_\_call__() method of classes to implement main logic. Make sure the model works with test tensors. For a graphical visual, look into using TensorBoard to display the constructed graph.

## Network List:
* Glimpse Network -> Geoffrey & Arsh
* Emission Network -> Oswald & James
* Recurrent Network -> Sean & Sepehr
* Classification Network -> Stanley, Khantil, & Ritvik
